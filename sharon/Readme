Here are the steps I did:

1. Policy Keyword Collection:
   - Collected a list of keywords for policies relevant to the two presidential candidates for the 2020 election according to the BCC NEWS titled "US election 2020: What are Trump's and Biden's policies?" at https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54507550.

2. Popularity Analysis:
   - Computed the number of tweets mentioning policy keywords.
   - Generated a frequency histogram to show their popularity on Twitter. 

3. - Computed the number of tweets mentioning the two presidential candidates.

4. Correlation Exploration:
   - Interested in exploring the correlation between presidential candidates and policies such as "covid" and "China".
   - Manually implemented the Chi-Square test to determine which presidential candidate is more correlated with which policy.
